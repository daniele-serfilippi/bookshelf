## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2.13 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] `^10.13 || 12 || 14`
- [npm][npm] v6 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

> If you want to commit and push your work as you go, you'll want to
> [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
> first and then clone your fork rather than this repo directly.

After you've made sure to have the correct things (and versions) installed, you
should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

```
git clone https://github.com/sermicromegas/bookshelf.git
cd bookshelf
npm install
```

This may take a few minutes.

If you get any errors, please read through them and see if you can find out what
the problem is. If you can't work it out on your own then please [file an
issue][issue] and provide _all_ the output from the commands you ran (even if
it's a lot).

If you are  unable to fix issues and you know how to use Docker 🐳 you can
setup the project with the following command:

```
docker-compose up
```

It's recommended you run everything locally in the same environment you work in
every day, but if you're having issues getting things set up, you can also set
this up using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).

## Running the app

To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:

```shell
npm start
```

This should start up your browser. If you're familiar, this is a standard
[react-scripts](https://create-react-app.dev/) application.

## Running the tests

```shell
npm test
```

This will start [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) in watch mode. Read the output and
play around with it.

### App Data Model

- User

  - id: string
  - username: string

- List Item

  - id: string
  - bookId: string
  - ownerId: string
  - rating: number (-1 is no rating, otherwise it's 1-5)
  - notes: string
  - startDate: number (`Date.now()`)
  - finishDate: number (`Date.now()`)

> For convenience, our friendly backend engineers also return a `book` object on
> each list item which is the book it's associated to. Thanks backend folks!

> /me wishes we could use GraphQL

If your "database" gets out of whack, you can purge it via:

```javascript
window.__bookshelf.purgeUsers();
window.__bookshelf.purgeListItems();
```

- Book

  - id: string
  - title: string
  - author: string
  - coverImageUrl: string
  - pageCount: number
  - publisher: string
  - synopsis: string
